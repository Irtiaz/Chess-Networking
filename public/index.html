	<h1> Welcome to the Online Chess game </h1>
	<h6> this project was developed by Md Irtiaz Kabir </h6>

	Rules are the same as normal chess. But you can't do the following - 
	<ul>
		<li>You can't castle</li>
		<li>When your pawn gets to the end of the other side it's not going to get promoted</li>
	</ul>
	<i>I am looking forward to add this features in the next release</i>

	<br><br>

	Press the button below to start a new match.
	Be patient after you press that because your opponent also needs to join!
